62. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example
For [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] and target=1, return 2.

For [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] and target=0, return -1.

Challenge
O(logN) time
